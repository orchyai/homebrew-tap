# Modes

Orchy offers three primary modes of operation.

![Workspace dashboard — Build Feature, Deploy, and Sessions](../images/workspace-dashboard.png)

---

## Build Mode

Jump straight into implementation. Build features across one or more projects with AI-powered planning and execution.

**Use when:** You have an existing project (or want to scaffold one from a template) and want to build features, fix bugs, or refactor code.

Build Mode takes you through the full workflow: [create a workspace](workspaces.md) → [describe a feature](building-features.md) → [plan](planning-and-sessions.md) → [execute](session-execution.md).

## Design Mode

Create a complete design system before writing any code. Generates color palettes, typography, component styles, and full-page mockups through an interactive chat.

**Use when:** You want to establish a visual design language before implementation, or you want ready-made design tokens and mockups to guide development.

See [Design Mode](design-mode.md) for the full workflow.

## Deployment Mode

Provision cloud infrastructure, set up CI/CD pipelines, and deploy your projects — all managed through an AI agent.

**Use when:** Your feature work is done and you want to deploy to production, or you need to modify existing infrastructure (upgrade servers, configure DNS, add monitoring, etc.).

Requires an **Orchy Managed** workspace with [GitHub integration](github-integration.md) enabled.

See [Deployment](deployment.md) for the full workflow.

## Resuming

If you have an active session, a **Resume** button appears on the mode selection screen to return to your in-progress work.
